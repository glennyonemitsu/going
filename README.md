# going
The best name for a Golang project if I do say so myself.

Going is a process manager similar to Python's Supervisord. Going is for the
programmer who wants a simple out-of-the-box way to make sure their hobby
programs are running, to take away the worry when updating a VPS or server. It
is not suitable for large scale deployments or any scenario where more advanced
features are required.

### Design
- Does not require root.
- Single binary to run everything via subcommands.
- Sample configuration files and scripts exportable via subcommands.
- Simple to download and run.

This is still in the very experimental stages.
